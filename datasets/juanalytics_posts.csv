Interestingly, you can't really find this function in the documentation and it is barely mentioned anywhere. I believe it has something to do with the fact that it is not usually supported by databases. Honestly, jitter plots are still a quick and dirty way of preventing overlap. It is not something I would highlight as a best practice... But I love to mention it just because of the RANDOM() function. P.S.

As you might expect with any big sample, positive and negative movies even each other out.

In relational algebra, the right solution is to transform the values you don't need into NULL and then append that one value to each row in a new column. Here is how that formula looks like in Tableau: AVG ( { MAX( IF [Field] = ""Value1"" // AND [Field] != ""Value2"" THEN { fixed [Field] : AGG([Measure]) } END ) } ) The syntax is not particularly elegant and you are all probably wondering: Why is there an AVG and then a MAX at the beginning? Let's start with the MAX. Tableau FORCES you to use an aggregate, but it really doesn't matter if you use MIN, MAX, AVG, or MEDIAN if there is only one value. I personally use MAX because that's how I roll (my glass is half-full), but it is fine if you use any of them. Except for SUM. The whole reason you should avoid using SUM and also why it is a wise idea to wrap the formula with an AVG is to avoid problems with duplicates. Confusing? I know.

It is a trade-off you always have to make: Do you care more about outliers or distribution? Fun facts: 1) ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" was the most negative movie. Mostly due to the graphic description of each death. Also, the words ""hell"" and ""kill"" appeared quite often. 2) There are 3 versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde between 1910 and 1920. 3) Slashers tend to have lower sentiment scores, while typical suspense thrillers tend to have neutral scores.

40,8,45,0,"I made two big mistakes when I first started learning Python. First mistake: Learning for the sake of learning. Instead of understanding what types of problems can Python solve for me, I just started googling. I came across tutorials to create websites, apps, and even video games. I did a handful of them, but I didn't learn much. Second mistake: Once I decided I wanted to learn about Python for data science, I went directly to learn Scikit-learn and Tensorflow. Without understanding the basics. As somebody without a technical background, here is my advise for anybody learning Python: 1) Find a problem that you want to solve with programming first and then decide what to learn. Your path will eventually take you to new applications, frameworks, or languages. But keep focus at first. Mine was to automate reports. 2) Be aware that many tutorials assume that you are familiar with programming concepts. The web is full of Python tutorials made for programmers who already know other programming languages. 3) If you want to learn Python for data science, start by getting familiar with Pandas and Numpy. Machine learning and deep learning can wait.

Document your KPIs: Everybody has a different idea of how to calculate a KPI. Do you remove frequent clients? Do you count internal traffic? Do you count it when they pay or when we deliver? Discuss these decisions with the stakeholders, think of alternative ways to calculate the same KPI, document it, and make the results available for everybody. 3.

72,6,125,11,"SELECT Client, AVG(Profit) AS Avg_Profit FROM Orders GROUP BY Client HAVING Avg_Profit > 0 This query is wrong, but it was fascinating to me when I found out why. Queries are evaluated in a particular order (i.e. Order of Operations). This might seem confusing at first because this order is different to order in which you type them. Going back to our query, SQL has to do the HAVING clause before it reads the SELECT in which you defined Avg_Profit. SQL does not know about that alias at that point, but this is hard for me to know since I had to define it so early in the process. Tableau takes this concept some levels beyond. LOD calculations, data source filters, quick filters, context filters, table calculations, blending, and the list goes on.

74,5,43,0,"Statistical mantra: You care about the relationship (if any) between two variables... Not just about correlation. Pearson's correlation, the most widely used metric, is good to find linear relationships between two variables. Assuming there are no outliers, both variables are normally distributed, and the data points are equally spread along the line. But what if the relationship can be better explained by something else than a line? You will often be fine by using corr(). But I would like to invite you to plot your data using a scatterplot first. Look for any predictable pattern like a curve, clusters, or a wave. If you find one, consider transform your data or use a different type of correlation (e.g. Kendall and Spearman). Or give up and create a proper model to explain this relationship. hashtag#datascience hashtag#statistics hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_datascience-statistics-juanalytics-activity-6505769120238170112-NZJF,Image,TRUE,Opinion,,FALSE

A boolean column indicating if something is NULL might be a good feature for a model. 5) Missing rows (i.e. rows that are not present in the data) behave differently than a NULL. One thing is to have some respondents not answering a couple of questions and the other is to have some respondents who didn't show up. 6) Consider making a model to input NULL values. Using the mean or removing those rows are not great solutions. 7) Always check your data with a histogram. Some people have a nasty tendency to input the mean or an arbitrary value (e.g. 99, 100, 0, -1) directly into the database. hashtag#datascience hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_datascience-juanalytics-activity-6506420874084646912-ugCi,Image,TRUE,Display,,FALSE

I spent the next couple of hours googling for the original dataset, I replicated the graph, and I made an improved version. Tip: Bar graphs are not great to show small differences between large quantities. Beginners might try to fix this by changing the starting point of the y-axis. However, not including 0 in your axes can be deceiving. A better alternative can be to transform or centralize those numbers. Next time you run into this problem, consider transforming the numbers into a percentage, subtract it from the mean, turn them into standard deviations from the mean, or use a logarithm transformation.

93,4,105,14,"It is difficult to get into the R integration in Tableau because most of the tutorials are not great. Most of them are not even made by R users. Consequently, you see countless R scripts that do things that Tableau can do natively or with the help of some calculated fields (e.g. correlation or the example below). Here are some tips about the actual script that I learned the hard way. 1. Most R functions will ask you to provide a data frame, but there is no way to refer to your Tableau environment. More often than not, you will have to create a data frame inside of your script using all of your arguments: df <- data.frame(.arg1, .arg2) 2. You can create multiple data frames inside of your script. However, you can only pull out of a vector of size 1 or as big as your data source per calculated field. This vector should be the last part of your script. 3. The R connection behaves similarly to dplyr::mutate when you create a new column. Most wrangling functions you might want to use on your data source are useless (e.g. tidyr::spread, dplyr::filter). 4. R scripts are Table Calculations. Meaning they are always aggregated with “Compute Using”, you cannot reference them in LOD calculations, and you have to be careful on how to apply filters. hashtag#tableau hashtag#datascience hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_tableau-datascience-juanalytics-activity-6516638359245328384-zPu9,Image,TRUE,Display,,FALSE

Including Excel files, high-quality images, assigning way too many colors to your dimensions, custom shapes. They all have to be opened and loaded. What a lot of people don't know is that if you click on “Assign Palette”, all of the shapes in a particular folder will be included in the packaged workbook. Making the file bigger and slowing the loading time. This happens even if you are only assigning a couple of them. When it comes to custom shapes, the best practice is: 1) Assign shapes to dimensions individually (click by click) 2) Be very mindful when you click on Assign Palette 3) Moderate big and high-quality icons (Tableau won’t render them that way either way). hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_juanalytics-activity-6531851521372483584-jPhW,Image,TRUE,Display,,

123,2,45,8,"One of the most dangerous misconceptions about SQL joins is that inner joins, left joins, or right joins will return as many rows as the biggest table or fewer. For example, a left join will always return the exact amount of rows in the left table and the result inner join will always be as big as the biggest table or smaller. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE! If your tables are not properly normalized, SQL might return more records than the biggest table. For example, if you have a left table with 100 rows, the outcome of your join will have at least 100 rows… But it might also return 200 or 1000 rows, depending on the content of both tables. My tips for you: • Always check if the unique identifier is indeed unique. • Check the size of your tables before and after the join. • Be skeptic about your data and double check everything. • Check for duplicates before you aggregate your data. hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_juanalytics-activity-6537597545726660608-CDbX,Image,TRUE,Display,,FALSE

125,2,76,4,"Another Tableau tip to spot duplicates in your data. When confronted with a situation like the one below: Multiple records per client and the data is not properly normalized, you might wonder: Are those 5 distinct purchases, one purchase duplicated 5 times, or a mix of the two? 5 is small enough for you to check your data manually and figure it out... But this might not be always possible. One easy way to figure this out is to add the standard deviation (STDEV) of that same measure to the color mark. If the standard deviation is 0, then all of the values are duplicates (or coincidentally all of the purchases cost the same). If the standard deviation is more than 0, that means that at least one of the records is not a duplicate. The reason I add it to the color is that the color legend is one of the quickest ways to see the range of your data. hashtag#juanalytics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmperafan_juanalytics-activity-6539109886473584641-DfIW,Image,TRUE,Display,,

Just because you like working with a tool, it doesn’t mean that the rest are awful. In fact, you don’t even need a good reason for a liking a particular tool. What is my invitation to all of you: 1. Stop bashing on other tools! Even if you were objectively right, you are not impressing anybody. 2.
