## Analyzing my own LinkedIn posts
<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperafan/">Juan Manuel Perafan</a></p>

<p>Back in October of 2018, I started posting data science and business intelligence tips on LinkedIn using the hashtag <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/juanalytics/">#juanalytics</a>. In a world saturated by content for beginners, my idea was to centralize content for mediors and advanced users of data tools like R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Alteryx, Excel. </p>

### Who am I?
My name is Juan. I am a 28-years-old Colombian, living in the Netherlands since 2011. I currently work as a BI consultant, but I have been working with data since 2014. My missions is to become a full-stack data generalist who is fluent in Business Intelligence, Data Engineering, and Data Science. For this, I think it is imperative to be tool agnostic at heart. 

For my work, I enjoy using tools like:
* Tableau
* PowerBI
* Alteryx
* Dataiku

Programming-wise, I am resonably fluent in:
* Python
* R
* SQL

Also noteworthy, I enjoy working with:
* Linux/Bash
* Google Cloud Platform
